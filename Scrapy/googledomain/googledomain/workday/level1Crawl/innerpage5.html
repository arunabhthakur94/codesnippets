           With new lease accounting standards (ASC 842) set to take effect at the end of the year, corporate accounting teams are focused on getting ready for the transition, which won’t be an easy one for many companies. In this interview, Robert Kugel, senior vice president and research director at Ventana Research, discusses the impact of the new lease standards, the challenges they create, and how finance should be thinking differently about compliance with these and future changes.

           In Gaelic, the word Aon means “Oneness,” a fitting name for a company that has grown through more than 500 acquisitions to become one of the leading professional services firms in the world. As the company has grown, so has the complexity of managing the business. Jim Kendall, vice president of finance solutions at Aon, discusses the challenges of running a fast-changing global business, his views on innovation and risk, and how a global, unified finance and HR system has made an impact on the business.

We sat down with Muchane to discuss the challenges he faced, the benefits of undertaking a project this way, and why Wake Forest ultimately selected Workday Financial Management and HCM.

           Technology has impacted many roles in academia, including the university registrar. Nancy Specht, assistant dean for institutional research and the university registrar for the University of Rochester in New York, explains how the registrar’s office has become a technology hub and partner to IT. Specht also talks about how the university is partnering with us and other customers on the continuing design of Workday Student, and why she turned from skeptic to Workday Student’s “biggest cheerleader.”

           It’s 6 p.m. on a Thursday, and a break room at Workday’s headquarters in Pleasanton, California is packed. A long table in the back is covered with pizzas, mostly untouched. Dinner can wait—the crowd is here to learn. The 200 people in attendance are members of Generation Workday and they’ve come to hear software engineering manager Kevin Jarvis talk about Workday’s object model. For many of them, Workday is their first professional job since graduating from college. They are the generation known as Millennials, and they represent the future of Workday.

           At Workday’s 7th annual Predict &amp; Prepare, a panel of industry experts discussed how individuals and organizations should best prepare for 2015 in the areas of finance, human resources, and technology. While they didn’t agree on everything, panelists did find areas of common ground. Chief among them was the growing opportunity to use data to gain insights.

           It’s a foundational capability that Naomi Bloom says is important not just to SaaS, but to all good software: the object model. In the third post of the foundations of real SaaS series, Naomi shares tips on how to take advantage of properly designed object models—and how to spot the imposters.

           We continue this Naomi Bloom four-part video series with a discussion about multi-tenancy. Does multi-tenancy matter for SaaS, and should customers care? It’s a debate that’s been waging for years. Naomi has strong views on this topic and describes the benefits of aggregation and inheritance, adding that, “I don’t see how these can be done without multi-tenancy. I’m waiting for someone to tell me.”

           Naomi Bloom, founder and managing partner of Bloom &amp; Wallace, sat down with us recently at Workday to talk about what she calls four of the foundational capabilities of SaaS—or at least, real SaaS. In the first segment of this four-part video series on SaaS (or enterprise cloud applications), Naomi discusses why configuration is a better choice than customization.

           As our chief accounting officer (CAO), Robynne Sisco manages day-to-day finances at Workday. We asked Robynne to share a bit about her role at the Workday Blog, as well as her unique perspective as a user of Workday’s financial management system. Robynne told us that being a CAO isn’t all about numbers and accounting regulations—at least not when you’re at a company that’s redefining finance for the enterprise.

           Our first Workday Rising Europe exceeded our expectations, and we’re still hearing from customers about the value they received and what they’d like to see next year. The conference packed in plenty of insights, news, and updates. This video captures highlights of the opening keynote featuring our Chairman, Co-Founder, and Co-CEO Aneel Bhusri, EMEA President Chano Fernandez, and others at the Park Plaza Westminster Bridge London on April 1, 2014.
